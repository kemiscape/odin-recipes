                <h2>Procedure</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
                        <br>
                        Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, milk and onion soup mix together in a large bowl until well combined; shape into 8 patties.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                        <br>
                        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Dredge patties in flour just to coat and quickly brown on both sides in the hot skillet. Place browned patties into the slow cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                        <br>
                        Mix condensed soup, water and au jus mix together in a medium bowl; pour over the beef patties. Cook on low until ground beef is well done, about 4 to 5 hours.
